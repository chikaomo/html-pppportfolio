 <h1>The Best Movies According To Chika</h1>
 <h2>Chika's Top 3 Movies</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Crazy Rich Asians</h3>
 <p>Absolutely loved everything about the movie. From Rachel finding out just how rich he was, to the drama and how they were still together at the end. the wedding was fabulous and the acting was amazing. It was definitely an emotional rollercoaster but a 10/10</p>
 <h3>Fast and Furious</h3>
 <p>i just love the entire saga. my favourites are 5,6,7 and 8. 10 definitely left me in shock because i never expected the ending and i really can't wait for 11 to come out</p>
 <h3>Doctor Strange</h3>
 <p>I'm such a marvel freak and it was honestly such a good movie. i loved everything about it and particularly love the character "doctor strange". it's a stark contrast from iron man, captain america, black widow, the hulk, etc because he isn't dealing with physical strength or gadgets like the other characters but instead he has magic, is the sorceror supreme and has the time stone. all in all, he's a badass</p>
